    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> It has been about 2 months since I started studying at GOA and have been loving it so far.Also I'am or at least were good at some sports.First sport I started playing was Rugby, which my friend introduced to me.
    I also do swimming. Thanks to my friend I have total of 5 medals in different sports. My school stuff is not so well, not so bad.</p>
